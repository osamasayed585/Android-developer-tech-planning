### Core Android

Android Interview Questions:

#### Base

* **Why does an Android App lag?** - [Learn from here](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/android-app-lag)

* **What is `Context`? How is it used?** - [Context In Android Application](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/context-in-android-application)

* **Tell all the Android application components.** - [Learn from here](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fundamentals.html#Components)

* **What is the project structure of an Android Application?** - [Learn from here](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects)

* **What is `AndroidManifest.xml`?**

* **What is `Application` class?**
    - The Application class in Android is the base class within an Android app that contains all other components such as activities and services. The Application class, or any subclass of the Application class, is instantiated before any other class when the process for your application/package is created.

#### Activity and Fragment

* **Why is it recommended to use only the default constructor to create a `Fragment`?** - [Learn from here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CitBt0FZFIc)

* **What is `Activity` and its lifecycle?**

* **What is the difference between onCreate() and onStart()**

* **When only onDestroy is called for an activity without onPause() and onStop()?** - [Learn from here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2kY_ckZa-g)

* **Why do we need to call setContentView() in onCreate() of Activity class?** - [Learn from here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1aHAt7XC5I)

* **What is onSavedInstanceState() and onRestoreInstanceState() in activity?**
    - onSavedInstanceState() - This method is used to store data before pausing the activity.
    - onRestoreInstanceState() - This method is used to recover the saved state of an activity when the activity is recreated after destruction. So, the onRestoreInstanceState() receive the bundle that contains the instance state information.

* **What is `Fragment` and its lifecycle.**

* **What are "launchMode"?** - [Learn from here](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/singletask-launchmode-in-android) and [singleTask launchMode in Android](https://youtu.be/WYkQEnm4jeI)

* **What is the difference between a `Fragment` and an `Activity`? Explain the relationship between the two.** - [Learn from here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10478233/why-fragments-and-when-to-use-fragments-instead-of-activities)

* **When should you use a Fragment rather than an Activity?**
    - When you have some UI components to be used across various activities
    - When multiple view can be displayed side by side just like viewPager

* **What is the difference between FragmentPagerAdapter vs FragmentStatePagerAdapter?**
    - FragmentPagerAdapter: Each fragment visited by the user will be stored in the memory but the view will be destroyed. When the page is revisited, then the view will be created not the instance of the fragment.
    - FragmentStatePagerAdapter: Here, the fragment instance will be destroyed when it is not visible to the user, except the saved state of the fragment.

* **What is the difference between adding/replacing fragment in backstack?** - [Learn from here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24466302/basic-difference-between-add-and-replace-method-of-fragment/24466345)

* **How would you communicate between two Fragments?**

* **What is retained `Fragment`?**
    - By default, Fragments are destroyed and recreated along with their parent Activityâ€™s when a configuration change occurs. Calling setRetainInstance(true) allows us to bypass this destroy-and-recreate cycle, signaling the system to retain the current instance of the fragment when the activity is recreated.

* **What is the purpose of `addToBackStack()` while commiting fragment transaction?**
    - By calling addToBackStack(), the replace transaction is saved to the back stack so the user can reverse the transaction and bring back the previous fragment by pressing the Back button.
